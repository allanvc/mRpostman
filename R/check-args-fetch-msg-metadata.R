#' @title Metadata Fetch Arguments Check
#'
#' @inherit check_args_fetch_full_msg description return
#'
#' @param imapconf An object of class \code{imapconf} generated with
#'     \link{configure_imap} and with a \code{mbox} item added after a
#'     mailbox selection with \link{select_mailbox}.
#' @param msg_id A numeric vetor containing one or more messages ids.
#' @param by Which id (\code{MSN} or \code{UID}) to use when searching for
#'     messages. \code{"MSN"} or message squence number is a message's relative
#'     position to the older message in the mailbox. It may change after deleting
#'     or moving messages. For instance, if a message is deleted, message sequence
#'     numbers are reordered to fill the gap. \code{"UID"} or unique identifier
#'     is always the same during the life cycle of a message. Default is
#'     \code{"MSN"}.
#' @param metadata A character vector or string specifying one or more items of
#'     the metadata of a message to fetch. See \link{metadata_options}.
#' @param write_to_file If \code{TRUE} writes fetch content of each message
#'     to the disk as a text file in the working directory. Default is \code{FALSE}.
#' @param keep_in_mem If \code{TRUE} keeps a copy of fetch results as an
#'     list in the R session when \code{write_to_file = TRUE}. Default is
#'     \code{FALSE}. It can only be set \code{TRUE} when
#'     \code{write_to_file = TRUE}.
#' @param retries Number of attempts to connect and execute the command. Default
#'     is \code{2}.
